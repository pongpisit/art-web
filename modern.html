        <h2>The Modern Art Period</h2>
        <p>
          Modern art represents a vast array of artistic movements and styles
          that emerged from the late 19th century to the mid-20th century. It
          marked a significant departure from traditional art forms, as artists
          began to experiment with new techniques, materials, and subject
          matters. Some of the most influential artists from the modern art
          period include Vincent van Gogh, Pablo Picasso, and Jackson Pollock.
