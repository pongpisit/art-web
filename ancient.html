        <h2>The Ancient Art Period</h2>
        <p>
          Ancient art refers to the artistic expressions of ancient
          civilizations, dating back thousands of years. It includes a vast
          array of styles, techniques, and media from different regions of the
          world. Some of the most well-known ancient art comes from
          civilizations like Egypt, Greece, and Rome.

          <p>
            Ancient Egyptian art dates back to around 3000 BCE and includes a
            wide range of artistic forms, such as sculptures, paintings, and
            architecture. Much of their art was created for religious purposes,
            including decorating tombs, temples, and monuments. Egyptian artists
            often used a combination of natural pigments and materials,
            including gold, limestone, and granite.

          <p>
            Ancient Greek art, spanning from around 900 BCE to 30 BCE, is
            renowned for its sculptures, pottery, and architecture. Greek
            artists developed new techniques and styles, such as the use of
            perspective and naturalistic depictions of the human body. Greek art
            often represented religious or mythological themes, as well as
            scenes from daily life.

          <p>
            Ancient Roman art, which began around 500 BCE and lasted until the
            fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 CE, was heavily influenced
            by Greek art but also developed its own unique characteristics.
            Roman artists created sculptures, frescoes, mosaics, and
            architecture, often depicting scenes of daily life, historical
            events, and mythological subjects. Roman art often served as a means
            of propaganda, promoting the power and authority of the Roman
            Empire.
