        <h2>The Contemporary Art Period</h2>
        <p>
          Contemporary art refers to art produced from the late 20th century to
          the present day. It encompasses a wide range of styles, techniques,
          and media, often reflecting and responding to the cultural, social,
          and political issues of the time. Some of the most influential
          contemporary artists include Yayoi Kusama, Banksy, and Ai Weiwei.

          <p>
            Yayoi Kusama is a Japanese contemporary artist who works primarily
            in sculpture and installation but is also active in painting,
            performance, film, fashion, poetry, fiction, and other arts. She is
            known for her iconic polka-dot patterns and infinity rooms. Kusama's
            work has been featured in numerous exhibitions worldwide, and she

          <p>
            Banksy is an anonymous England-based street artist, political
            activist, and film director. His satirical street art and subversive
            epigrams combine dark humor with graffiti executed in a distinctive
            stenciling technique. Banksy's works of political and social
            commentary have been featured on streets, walls, and bridges of
            cities throughout the world.

          <p>
            Ai Weiwei is a Chinese contemporary artist and activist who works in
            sculpture, installation, photography, film, architecture, and social
            criticism. He is known for his use of unconventional materials and
            his engagement with political and social issues, particularly those
            relating to China. Some of Ai Weiwei's most famous works include the
            Sunflower Seeds installation and the Bird's Nest Olympic Stadium in
            Beijing.
